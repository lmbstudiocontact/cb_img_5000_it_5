    "Little research has been carried out into the changing role of landed estates in forming and maintaining woodland landscapes in this period.",
    "Rather than being a slowly changing woodland landscape it has undergone revolutionary changes.",
    "As only one point in each site was sampled the effects of within woodland turnover, particularly in the larger sites, would have been missed.",
    "There were several small woodland glades dominated by various grasses.",
    "In woodlands, nutrient cycling is steady but slow compared with the faster rate of cycling in cleared pastures.",
    "Significantly, this includes the almost complete felling of existing woodlands to create a shelter wood with as few as 20-40 stems per hectare.",
    "Using an illustrative model, we show that transitions between grassland and woodland may result from the interplay of facilitation and competition between herbivores.",
    "This table shows that fly really became more numerous in the vlei than in the woodland bordering it."
