    "The violinist with the singer was an excellent performer.",
    "Moreover, at the same time a similar project for violinists, which also combines general music lessons with instrumental lessons in small groups, was launched.",
    "First, there is something inherently unnatural for a standing violinist to try while playing to locate a pedal on the ground and step on it.",
    "Although you and the violinist are both moral agents capable of incurring obligations, the fetus is not because it lacks both of the above characteristics.",
    "However, the same result could be caused by unconsciously projecting one's impressions regarding the violinists' dress directly on to one's ratings of the performance.",
    "The violinist with the singers was an excellent performer.",
    "In these cases, however, evidently also the violinists rated low on the extra-musical attributes received at least slightly higher ratings in the audio-visual condition.",
    "Likewise, watching a good pantomime of a vigorously sawing virtuoso violinist evokes an expressive sound performance."
