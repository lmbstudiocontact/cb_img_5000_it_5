    "Sometimes the cremated remains are placed in an urn, but more commonly they are scattered in a small pit or placed in an organic container.",
    "Two other large urns were reported to have been found during street construction some 15 m from the salvaged urn.",
    "Because the remains were cremated and because the urns and the monument lack hieroglyphs, it is difficult to know who the two personages were.",
    "The form is a pedestal topped by an urn, the classical symbol of death and mourning.",
    "In this paper, we present several probabilistic transforms related to classical urn models.",
    "In the middle of these six locations with offerings, we found a large jar that was likely a funerary urn.",
    "Therefore, the combinatorial model for the case of unlabelled urns has a different structure and interpretation from the case of labelled urns."
